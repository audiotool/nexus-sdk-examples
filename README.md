# Nexus SDK Examples

This repository contains examples for using the nexus sdk. You find them 
in the `examples` directory. The easiest way to try them out is to:
* pull the repo to disk
* `cd` to an example dir
* call `npm i && npm run dev`


To authenticate yourself, create a file called `pat.txt` inside the `examples/` directory
and put the personal access token you get from https://rpc.audiotool.com/dev/.
